1. Introduction
This project is a simple web-based app designed to allow doctors/medical professionals to manage their patients’ medical records efficiently. It’s an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, which is a digital way to store and manage patient information. EHRs are important in modern healthcare  fields because they make data easily accessible over a network or the internet and allow for efficient, quick, and easy access to patient information.
With this app, users can:
1.	Create their own accounts.
2.	Add, delete and edit patient profiles and patient records.
3.	Save important medical details, like medications and allergies.
4.	View details for each patient’s profile.

2. Website/App Design and Technical Architecture 
 

Figure 1: Design chart


This project is built using simple, but effective tools to create a practical and easy-to-use website for managing patient records
Frontend: The website layout and styling were designed using HTML and Bootstrap, along with jQuery, Popper.js, and Bootstrap's JavaScript components for interactivity.
Backend: The app’s functionality is powered by Flask, a Python framework utilized for handling the logic behind the app’s functions, such as user login and patient data management.
Database: Alembic version, doctors, patients and medical records are stored in SQLite.

As for the versions of the tools used; for the backend, we used the following:
Flask, (v2.3.0)
Flask-SQLAlchemy, (v3.0.0)
Flask-Migrate, (v4.0.1)
Flask-Login, (v0.6.2)
Werkzeug, (v2.3.5)
Flask-WTF, (v1.1.1)
WTForms, (v3.0.1)
As for the frontend:
Bootstrap, (v4.5.2)
jQuery, (v3.5.1-slim)
Popper.js, (v2.4.4)
As for the database: we used SQLite (v3.40.1)
3. EHR Information System
Our web app contains several pages, each serving a specific purpose to allow for managing patient data in a simple way.
3.1   Starting Page
Provides options to log in or register. Once logged in, users will be redirected to the homepage.

3.2   Register Page
- Allows users to create an account by typing in a name and password, then verifying the password by typing it in once more. The password should contain at least one capital letter, one number, and one special character/symbol.

3.3   Login Page
- Allows users to enter their credentials to access the system.

3.4   Home Page
- This is where the user can add patients, display a list of their added patients where they can modify/add/delete records and their details, delete patients from the database and log out.

3.5   Add Patient Page
- Includes a form to input basic patient information, such as name, gender, blood type, and birth date.

3.6   Patient List Page
- Displays all patients in a table format for easy access.

3.7   Medical Records Page
- Shows input fields/textboxes to input a patient’s medical history, which can be edited later on.

3.8   Delete Patient Page
- Shows an input field where the user can put in the patient ID generated by the database to delete said patient from the database. If the ID that was put in doesn’t exist in the database, it will throw back an error to the user, notifying them that it doesn’t exist.

4. System Evaluation
We used the System Usability Scale (SUS), as introduced during our course (Material 2). to evaluate the usability of our EHR system. One user used the SUS questionnaire provided through this link (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSffP2xuW3ZywZ1nz0dsXc1DXLbjPYQE3gW3azqAo87LfdRVmA/viewform) to gauge their opinion of the website and got the following:

Q1: 4
Q2: 1
Q3: 5
Q4: 1
Q5: 3
Q6: 2
Q7: 5
Q8: 1
Q9: 5
Q10: 2

Through the SUS calculations, in which we first sum the score contributions from each item. Each item's score contribution will range from 0 to 4. For odd-numbered items, the score contribution is the scale position minus 1. For even-numbered items, the contribution is 5 minus the scale position, then multiplying their sum by 2.5, we get the following:
Odd-numbered items:
(4-1) +(5-1) +(3-1) +(5-1) +(5-1) = 3 + 4 + 2 + 4 + 4 = 17
Even-numbered items:
(5-1) +(5-1) +(5-2) +(5-1) +(5-2) = 4 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 3 = 18

Here’s a graph where the above is displayed in an easier-to-understand form:

Q. No.	Chosen point (X)	Odd/Even	Equation	Calculation	The result
Q1	4	Odd	X - 1	4 – 1	3
Q2	1	Even	5 - X	5 – 1	4
Q3	5	Odd	X - 1	5 – 1	4
Q4	1	Even	5 - X	5 – 1	4
Q5	3	Odd	X - 1	3 – 1	2
Q6	2	Even	5 - X	5 – 2	3
Q7	5	Odd	X - 1	5 – 1	4
Q8	1	Even	5 - X	5 – 1	4
Q9	5	Odd	X - 1	5 – 1	4
Q10	2	Even	5 - X	5 - 2	3
	∑ = 35


SUS Score:
(17 + 18) * 2.5 = 35 * 2.5 = 87.5, which indicates that our system is highly usable compared to the SUS benchmark of 68.



5.	Team Contribution
We divided the project among ourselves as follows: two members were responsible for the frontend, two for the backend, and one for integrating the frontend with the backend and preparing the database. However, throughout the work process, the team collaborated and shared insights on each other's parts. Some minor adjustments were made to align with the final vision of the project.
In general, the responsibilities of each member were as follows:

Team Members
	Contribution
Mohammad El-Masri	Backend + Database
Mohamed Sadik	Frontend + Report Preparation
Youssef Daoud	Backend + Chart Preparation
Mohamed Nouh	Frontend + Report Preparation
Hesham Elmogy	Connecting Frontend to Backend + Database
